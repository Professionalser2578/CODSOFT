## Description

1) **Tic-Tac-Toe Game**

    A console-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to play against each other.

      - *Game Board*: Create a 3x3 grid as the game board
      - *Players*: Assign "X" and "O" to two players
      - *Display Board*: Show the current state of the board
      - *Player Input*: Prompt the current player to enter their move
      - *Update Board*: Update the game board with the player's move

      - *Play Again*: Ask if the players want to play another game

     
2) **Simple Calculator**

   A program that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It allows user to input two numbers and choose an operation to perform.

3) **Number Guessing Game**

    A program that generates a random number and asks the user to guess it. Additionally, it provides feedback on whether the guess is too high or too low until the user guesses the correct number.
